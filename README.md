# World Life Expectancy & US Household Income Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains two data analysis projects: World Life Expectancy and US Household Income. Both projects focus on cleaning, exploring, and analyzing datasets to uncover meaningful insights through SQL queries and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
World Life Expectancy: Analyzes global life expectancy data, including trends over time, correlations with factors like GDP, and regional differences.
US Household Income: Examines household income and demographic data across the United States, focusing on income distributions, geographic patterns, and statistical summaries.

## Objectives
1. Clean the dataset by handling duplicates and missing values
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and relationships
3. Examine factors influencing life expectancy across different countries

## 1. Data Cleaning
-Both projects include SQL scripts to handle:
Missing or inconsistent values
Duplicate records
Typographical errors
Standardization of categorical variables

### World Life Expectancy Cleaning
Corrected country names and years
Handled missing life expectancy and GDP values
Standardized metrics for consistency

### US Household Income Cleaning
Fixed state name misspellings (e.g., "georia" to "Georgia")
Removed duplicate IDs
Updated empty or incorrect place names
Standardized type categories (e.g., "Boroughs" to "Borough")

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzes life expectancy ranges by country
The EDA scripts provide insights into:

### World Life Expectancy:
Trends in life expectancy by country and region
Correlations between life expectancy and economic/health factors
Outliers and anomalies in the data

### US Household Income:
Income distribution by state, county, and type
Geographic patterns (land/water area vs. income)
Median and mean income comparisons
